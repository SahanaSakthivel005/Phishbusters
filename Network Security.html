        <h1>Network Security</h1>
        <p>
            <ul> Types of Network Attacks:
                Imagine your network as a bustling castle. Network attacks like DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) are akin to an army swarming the gates, overwhelming the guards. Man-in-the-Middle attacks are like secret spies intercepting and altering messages between the king and his allies. Sniffing is like eavesdropping on private conversations. Understanding these attacks helps you fortify your defenses.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):
                Think of firewalls as the castle walls and drawbridges, keeping out unwanted visitors. IDS are your watchtowers, constantly scanning for suspicious activities and sounding the alarm when something's amiss. Together, they form the frontline defense against digital invaders.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):
                VPNs are like secret tunnels under the castle, allowing safe and encrypted passage for messengers. They ensure that sensitive data travels securely, away from the prying eyes of cyber adversaries.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Secure Network Design:
Just as a well-designed castle with moats and ramparts is harder to breach, a network designed with security in mind is more resilient. This includes segmenting the network, using strong authentication methods, and regularly updating defenses.
            </ul>
