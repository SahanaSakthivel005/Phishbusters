            <ul> 
                Threat Intelligence and Analysis: Gathering and analyzing information about current and potential cyber threats to prevent and respond to attacks. This involves studying attack patterns and hacker techniques.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): Sophisticated, prolonged cyberattacks often orchestrated by nation-states or organized groups. APTs aim to steal data or disrupt operations without being detected.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Machine Learning and AI in Cybersecurity: Using artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect and respond to cyber threats. These technologies can identify unusual patterns and predict potential threats.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Behavioral Analytics: Monitoring and analyzing user behavior to detect anomalies that could indicate a security threat. This involves studying how users typically interact with systems and identifying deviations.
            </ul>
