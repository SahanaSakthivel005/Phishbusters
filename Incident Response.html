                Steps in Incident Handling:
Incident response is the strategic plan for when the castle is under attack. Preparation involves training and readiness. Detection is spotting the invaders. Containment and eradication are the battle strategies to stop and remove threats. Recovery is rebuilding and fortifying the castle.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Incident Response Plans and Playbooks:
                These are detailed blueprints and manuals for dealing with attacks. They outline who does what and when, ensuring a coordinated and effective response to any security incident.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Forensics and Evidence Collection:
                Digital forensics is the investigative work after an attack, like a detective piecing together clues. Collecting evidence helps identify the culprits and understand how the attack happened, crucial for preventing future breaches.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Post-Incident Analysis and Reporting:
After an incident, analyzing what happened and reporting findings are essential. It's like a debriefing session where you learn from the attack, improve defenses, and ensure you're better prepared for future threats.
            </ul>
