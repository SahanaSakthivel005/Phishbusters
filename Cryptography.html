                Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption:
Symmetric encryption is like a locked treasure chest where both the sender and receiver share the same key to open it. Asymmetric encryption involves a public key for locking the chest and a private key for unlocking it, ensuring only the rightful owner can access the treasure.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Common Algorithms:
Algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) are the intricate locks on your digital treasure chests. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) are powerful tools used to create these locks and keys, ensuring your data remains secure.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Hashing Functions:
Hashing functions are like fingerprints for data. They create unique, fixed-size signatures (hashes) for any input, allowing you to verify the integrity of your data. SHA-256 and MD5 are popular hashing algorithms used to ensure data hasn't been tampered with.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Digital Signatures and Certificates:
Digital signatures are the wax seals on a letter, verifying the sender's identity and the message's authenticity. Certificates are digital passports, confirming the identity of websites and encrypting communications to ensure trustworthiness.
