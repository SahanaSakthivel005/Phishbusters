                Common Web Vulnerabilities:
Web vulnerabilities like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and SQL Injection are sneaky traps set by attackers to steal data or take control of websites. Understanding these vulnerabilities helps you build stronger defenses and avoid these pitfalls.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Secure Coding Practices:
Writing secure code is like crafting a sturdy, well-constructed castle. It involves validating user input, avoiding hard-coded secrets, and following best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Security Headers and Web Application Firewalls (WAF):
Security headers are additional layers of protection, like reinforced gates, that instruct browsers on how to handle website content securely. WAFs act as vigilant guards, inspecting incoming traffic and blocking malicious attempts to breach the website.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                HTTPS and SSL/TLS:
HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) are the encrypted highways for data travel. They ensure that information exchanged between your browser and the website remains private and secure from eavesdroppers.
            </ul>
