        <p>
            <ul> 
                Quantum Cryptography: Leveraging quantum mechanics to create secure communication systems that are theoretically unbreakable by classical computers.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies: Using decentralized ledgers to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin rely on blockchain for security.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Zero-Knowledge Proofs: A method by which one party can prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Cryptographic Protocols (TLS, IPsec): Protocols like TLS (Transport Layer Security) and IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) that provide secure communication over networks by encrypting data.
            </ul>
