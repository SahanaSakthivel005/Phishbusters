                Antivirus and Antimalware:
Antivirus and antimalware programs are the vigilant sentries on your devices, constantly scanning for malicious software (malware) and swiftly neutralizing threats to keep your system safe.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):
EDR solutions are like advanced security systems in your digital fortress. They monitor endpoints (like computers and mobile devices), detect suspicious activities, and respond to threats in real-time, ensuring quick containment and remediation.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Secure Configurations and Hardening:
Hardening your endpoints means setting up your devices with strong security measures, like disabling unnecessary services and enforcing strict access controls. It's like turning your castle into an impregnable fortress.
            </ul>
